    <!-- ABOUT -->
    <section class="about">
      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>
        I’m a mechanical engineer with <strong>5 years of hands-on experience</strong>
        in automotive design and technical support. My primary design tool is
        <strong>CATIA</strong>, where I create accurate and manufacturable
        <strong>3D models and 2D drawings</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also use <strong>BETA CAE (ANSA)</strong> for geometry cleanup,
        midsurface extraction, meshing, and quality checks to support CAE requirements.
        In addition, I use Solidworks for simple 3D modeling and basic analysist to assist in
        design validation.
      </p>

      <p>
        I focus on clean design data, manufacturability, and practical engineering solutions that
        help projects move efficiently from concept to production.

          <h3>Gaming Mouse Concept Design (Aesthetic Study)</h3>

          <p>
            This project is a styling study created entirely from scratch using CATIA V5. 
            The goal was to design a multi-part aesthetic model, organize the assembly structure, 
            and generate clear visualization outputs such as isometric and exploded views.
            <br><br>
            This model is not intended for manufacturing. It serves as a demonstration of my skills in:

          <p>
            Personal CAD study project of a side bracket developed in CATIA V5 to practice 
            3D modeling and 2D drawing standards. This design is for learning and 
            demonstration purposes only.
