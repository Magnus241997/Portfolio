    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I’m a mechanical engineer with 5 years of hands-on experience in automotive design and technical support.
      My primary design tool is <strong>CATIA</strong>, where I create accurate and manufacturable
      <strong>3D models and 2D drawings (drafting)</strong> for metal and plastic components.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also have experience in <strong>BETA CAE (ANSA)</strong>, working on geometry cleanup,
      midsurface extraction, meshing, and quality checks to support basic CAE and simulation requirements.
      In addition, I use <strong>SolidWorks</strong> for simple 3D modeling and basic analysis to assist in design validation.
    </p>
    <p>
      I focus on clean design data, manufacturability, and practical solutions that help projects move
      efficiently from concept to production.
